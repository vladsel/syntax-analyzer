# syntax_analyzer

(25.05.2022)
1. Develop a parser (SA) program for a subset of the SIGNAL programming language according to the grammar.
2. The program must provide the following:
• reading a line of tokens and tables generated by lexical 
the analyzer that was developed (lexical-analyzer);
• syntactic analysis (parsing) of a program represented by a string of tokens using the method of recursive descent;
• construction of a parsing tree;
• formation of tables of identifiers and various constants with complete information necessary for code generation;
• formation of a listing of the incoming program with messages about 
lexical and syntactic errors.

Requirements for the parser program
1. It is forbidden to use any library tools for working with regular expressions;
2. The input of the parser should be the following:
• an encoded string of tokens;
• tables of identifiers, numeric, character and string 
constants generated by the lexical analyzer;
• an input program on a subset of the SIGNAL programming language 
according to the grammar.
3. The output of the parser should be the following:
• parsing tree of the input program;
• tables of identifiers and various constants with complete information necessary for code generation;
• listing of the input program with messages about lexical and syntactic errors.
4. The parsing tree must contain
• all non-terminals, without exception, by which the input code was analyzed;
• that is, if you do not have any list (ie, for 
grammar can be <empty>), then it is necessary to show in 
tree all the way up to and including <empty>.
5. Grammar rules that contain the alternative <empty>, 
in fact, allow the use of empty structures.
